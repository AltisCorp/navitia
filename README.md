Welcome!

navitia.io is an API to build cool stuff with public transport. We provide journeys computation,
line schedules, easy access to anything related to public transport and sexy things such as isochrones.

Come and play with it at http://www.navitia.io.

Give us feedback to make it even more awesome.
